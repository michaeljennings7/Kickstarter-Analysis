## An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data using pivot tables and filters.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this challenge and subsequent analysis was to use Kickstarter Data to learn Excel basics. In doing so I learned much more about how to use functions to make data analysis easier and much faster than sifting through thousands of rows of data to analyze manually. In terms of the challenge itself, the purpose of this challenge was to tell a story about specific Kickstarter data about theater productions. Whether it was through pivot tables, graphs or calculations, this challange walked me through how to do that effectively and using visually digestable representations of that raw data.



## Analysis and Challenges

Overall I would say that my performance on this challenge was fairly good considering my lack of meaningful experience with Excel. My background since I graduated University was with Salesforce, so my interactions with Excel were limited to the sporadic .CSV data load. So this first experience with Excel was eye opening, moderately challenging, and fun. One challenge I had while completing this challenge was with the COUNTIFS function. I had to rewatch the video hint a few times to really understand the concept and I made sure to follow the example in the hint video as well.

My approach to performing the analysis itself was fairly straightforward as well. I relied on past work and examples I had already worked through in the homework prior to the challenge. For example, I could not remember how to create a percentage so I went back to the Kickstarter to a column and checked the function we had already used to create a percentage.

## Results

Two conclusions I can draw from the Theater Outcomes by Laucnch Date data are as follows:
1) May and June seem to be the most successful months to launch a Kickstarter.
2) May and June are also the most popular months to launch a Kickstarter as well.

These conclusions lend themselves to the limitation of this particualr dataset. In order to draw more meaningful conclusions there would need to be more analysis done. For example, the fact that May and June are the most popular months to start a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, a percentage of successful campaigns would be more meaningful. Another limitation comes in the form of the Parent and Subcategories. While categories can always be sub-categorized, there could be many more breakout charts and pivot tables using those categories to draw meaningful conclusions. A good example of this would be to include futher theater sub-categories such as musicals, ballets, operas, etc. to see if any trends could be seen across different theatrical events in addition to just plays.
